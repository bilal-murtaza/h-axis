# GitHub Actions Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ❌ Package-lock.json Not Found

**Problem**: GitHub Actions was looking for `package-lock.json` because it was configured to use npm caching, but the project uses pnpm.

**Solution**:

- Removed `cache: 'npm'` from Node.js setup
- Added proper pnpm cache configuration using `pnpm store path`
- Uses `pnpm-lock.yaml` for cache key instead of `package-lock.json`

### 2. ❌ DNS Configuration Error

**Problem**: Missing CNAME file for custom domain `axis.easyapps.io`

**Solution**:

- Updated build script to automatically create CNAME file
- Updated GitHub Actions to include CNAME creation
- Created comprehensive DNS setup guide

### 3. ⚡ Workflow Optimization

**Changes**:

- Removed pull request trigger (only deploy on push to master/main)
- Added `workflow_dispatch` for manual triggering
- Added debug step to list dist contents
- Simplified deployment conditions

## Updated Files:

1. **`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`**
    - Fixed pnpm caching
    - Added CNAME creation
    - Added debug output
    - Optimized triggers

2. **`build-static.sh`**
    - Enabled CNAME file creation for `axis.easyapps.io`

3. **`DNS_SETUP.md`** (New)
    - Complete DNS configuration guide
    - Troubleshooting steps
    - Verification commands

## Next Steps:

### 1. Configure DNS Records

Add this CNAME record in your DNS provider for `easyapps.io`:

```
Type: CNAME
Name: axis
Value: bilal-murtaza.github.io
TTL: 3600
```

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to Repository Settings → Pages
2. Set Source to "GitHub Actions"
3. Add custom domain: `axis.easyapps.io`

### 3. Deploy

Push your changes to trigger the deployment:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix pnpm deployment and add DNS configuration"
git push origin master
```

### 4. Verify Deployment

After the workflow completes:

- Check the Actions tab for any errors
- Verify CNAME file is created in the deployment
- Test the domain once DNS propagates

## Troubleshooting:

If you still see issues:

1. Check the Actions tab for detailed logs
2. Verify DNS propagation: `dig axis.easyapps.io CNAME`
3. Use the debug output to see dist folder contents
4. Test locally first: `./build-static.sh && pnpm static:preview`
